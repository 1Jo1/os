# Documentation for the `master` version of `rancher/os`

This dir is _not_ the documentation for any released version of RancherOS.
You can find that at the [Rancher Labs Documentation site](https://docs.rancher.com) and
specifically for [RancherOS](https://docs.rancher.com/os/).

When there are Pull Requests to the `rancher/os` repository that affect the user (or developer),
then it should include changes to the documenation in this directory.

When we make a new release of RancherOS, the `docs/os` dir will be copied into the `rancher/rancher.github.io`
repository to be accessible by users.
